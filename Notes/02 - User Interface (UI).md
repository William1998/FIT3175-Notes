# User Interface (UI)
The ISO Definition: [**User Interface (UI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) is where all components of an interactive system (software or hardware) that provide information and controls for the user to accomplish specific tasks with the interactive system.

### Additional Definition
Stone et al, User Interface Design and Evaluation (2005): User Interface (UI) is that part of a computer system with which a user interacts in order to undertake his or her tasks and achieve his or her goals.

### What is an Interaction and what are the makes of a Good Interaction?
* Interactions are moments of contextual gestalt and one element has a direct impact on the other.
* It requires us to go beyond aesthetics and intuition.
* We need to interpret Usability and Design as a science where we turn to theories, models and principles.

### Metaphors
* The use of one idea or object to represent another; making an implicit comparison between concepts to provide insight into those concepts.
* Metaphors are used widely to help set users’ expectations and make the behavior of computers clearer.
* The “desktop metaphor” :computer: is used to suggest that a computer screen is like a physical desk, with papers and folders to shuffle around and various desk accessories, such as calculators, printers, and notepads.
* A general physical world metaphor is what allows a beveled border to suggest a button and allows close parallel lines to suggest that something is draggable.
* Cons:
  * There aren’t enough good metaphors to go around, they don't scale well.
  * The ability of users to recognise them is often questionable, especially across cultural boundaries.
  * You can take a Metaphor too far.
 
### Interface Icons  
1. **Resemblance Icons.**   
Actual 1:1 graphical representation (i.e., drawing of a thing it is actually depicting). :email: :clock3: 

2. **Exemplar Icons.**  
An example of a typical class of objects (e.g., knife and fork meaning ‘restaurant’).
Not common in UIs.    

3. **Symbolic Icons (or Reference).**  
Depicting by reference or analogy (e.g., the winzip logo, where files/folders are
squeezed by a clamp).    

4. **Arbitrary Icons.** 
Icons that don’t mean anything, that we have just come to agree on (e.g.,Traffic signs are often arbitrary icons and may form a good source of computer icons because of their fairly standardized international use). :warning:  
    * A small picture of a floppy disk is used to represent the “Save” command in many graphical user interface (GUI) designs. :floppy_disk:
    * Originally, this was a resemblance icon: users actually saved their files on floppies, so as long as the icon looked reasonably like a floppy disk, it was likely to be recognized and understood.
    * Later, people got hard drives and the “Save” icon became a reference icon.
    * Today, many younger users have never seen a floppy disk, and the icon has become an arbitrary icon for these users.
    * As this example shows, the classification of an icon can change over time or with other changes in context.
