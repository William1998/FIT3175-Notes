# User Interface (UI)
The ISO Definition: [**User Interface (UI)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) is where all components of an interactive system (software or hardware) that provide information and controls for the user to accomplish specific tasks with the interactive system.

### Additional Definition
Stone et al, User Interface Design and Evaluation (2005): User Interface (UI) is that part of a computer system with which a user interacts in order to undertake his or her tasks and achieve his or her goals.

### What is an Interaction and what are the makes of a Good Interaction?
* Interactions are moments of contextual gestalt and one element has a direct impact on the other.
* It requires us to go beyond aesthetics and intuition.
* We need to interpret Usability and Design as a science where we turn to theories, models and principles.

### Metaphors
* The use of one idea or object to represent another; making an implicit comparison between concepts to provide insight into those concepts.
* Metaphors are used widely to help set users’ expectations and make the behavior of computers clearer.
* The “desktop metaphor” :desktop_computer: is used to suggest that a computer screen is like a physical desk, with papers and folders to shuffle around and various desk accessories, such as calculators, printers, and notepads.
* A general physical world metaphor is what allows a beveled border to suggest a button and allows close parallel lines to suggest that something is draggable.
