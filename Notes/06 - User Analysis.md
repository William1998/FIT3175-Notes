# User Analysis
1. **Interviews** 
    * Unstructured.
        * You don’t plan in advance. Maybe you know your initial question, then you just go with the flow.
        * This results in really rich, deep data. But makes replication impossible and can make analysis more ad-hoc/difficult, if you are not careful.
    * Structured
        * Tightly scripted. Almost a spoken questionnaire.
        * Simple to replicate, simple to analyse. No opportunity for you to respond to something really interesting and (perhaps) unexpected.
    * Semi-structured
        * More of a plan, such as topics/themes you want to cover. But also more open to exploration and deviation.
        * Pseudo-replicable, somewhat comparable across interviewees, medium difficult to analyse.
