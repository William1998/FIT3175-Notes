# Qualitative v Quantitative
Quantitative methods yield numerical results.
Qualitative methods give results in terms of observations, comments, thoughts, etc.

Let’s say quantitative gives us ‘what’, and qualitative gives us ‘why’

### When to 'Quantitate'?
1. Numerical results are typically easier to tie back to your companies Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These are what businesses use to measure their success (especially for high-level reporting to stakeholders). Obvious KPIs:
    * Website Behaviour – Page Views, Conversion Rate.
    * Sales and Marketing – Social media review ratings.
    * Financial Metrics – profit, margins, active customers.
    
2. We can start to look at ‘statistical significance’ (or expand findings to be
representative of a whole population).

3. Easier to capture objective data (how long does a task actually take vs. how long do people think it takes).

4. Easy to make nice visualisations (and people love visualisations). You’ll never get money for anything without a nice graph!

### When to 'Qualitate'?
1. Capture subjective feedback, for insights into people’s opinions, beliefs, etc.

2. Presenting real ‘people’, with real emotional feedback is very powerful too (some stakeholders will be more convinced by this).

3. Better for capturing performance/preference trade-offs (perhaps your new design speeds up checkout by 30%, but people feel a massive loss of control).

4. Gives more customer face time (develops relationships, shows you care).

5. Gives a good insight into the whole subjective experience (and this is what a large part of UX is all about).
