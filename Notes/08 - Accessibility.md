# Accessibility
‘Ability to access’ and benefit from a system or entity.

### Famous views
‘Technology is accessible if it can be used as effectively by people with disabilities as by those without’ (Thatcher, 2004).

‘Everyone should be able to access and enjoy the web’ (Google).

‘We need to make every single thing accessible to every single person with a disability’ (Stevie Wonder, 2016).

‘Its all about ensuring inclusive participation and access to information for all people, no matter what their abilities or circumstances. ...to develop guidelines and resources to help make the web accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.’ (Vision Australia, 2019).

### Understanding Accessibility
1. There is a misconception that very few people have a disability.

2. Disabilities affect 10-20% of the population.

3. Disabilities can be temporary, resulting from illness and accidents.

4. Old age can easily result in manifest disabilities: affecting vision, hearing, memory and motor skills.

5. Old/crappy technology can act as a disability, causing cause limitations and incompatibility.

### How to design for accessibility?
1. At a really high level, ignoring all nuance.

2. Enable multi-modal input and output. Allow users to access content without having to rely on just one of their senses.

3. Make things as clear and simple as possible. Don’t over-complicate things.

4. Accessible websites are more SEO friendly, have faster download times, encourage good coding practices, and always have better usability.

5. Basically, if you do accessibility correctly, it is amazing for people with a disability, and everyone else either doesn’t notice, or also benefits.

### WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 
Guidelines help ensure your website is accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities including blindness, low vision, deafness, hearing loss, cognitive and motor impairments, etc.

WCAG 2.0 are written as testable statements, easy to determine if your site/app is accessible.

WCAG has 4 principles:
  * Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive information and UI elements (they must be available to at least one of their senses).
  * Operable: Users must be able to operate the interface (can’t require an interaction the user can’t perform).
  * Understandable: Users must be able to understand any information and the UI.
  * Robust: Content must be robust to changes in technology, and assistive technologies.
