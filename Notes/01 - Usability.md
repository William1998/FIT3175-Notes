# Usability
The ISO Definition: [**Usability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability) is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with **effectiveness**, **efficiency** and **satisfaction** in a specified _context_ of use.

**Effectiveness** - Accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals.

**Efficiency** - Resources expended in relation to the 'effectiveness' with which users achieve goals.

**Satisfaction** - Freedom from discomfort and positive attitude towards the use of the product.

### Additional Definition
[The Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability): Usability is part of the broader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. A design is not usable or unusable _per se_; its features, together with the context of the user (what the user wants to do with it and the user’s
environment), determine its level of usability.

[Jakob Nielsen (2012)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/): “Usability is a quality attribute that assesses
how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process. “Usability is defined by 5 quality components, Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors and Satisfaction”
