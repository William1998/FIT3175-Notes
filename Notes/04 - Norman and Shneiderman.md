### Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules

* **Strive for Consistency** 
  * by utilizing familiar icons, colors, menu hierarchy, call-to-actions, and user flows when designing similar situations and sequence of actions. 
  * Standardizing the way information is conveyed ensures users are able to apply knowledge from one click to another; without the need to learn new representations for the same actions. 
  * Consistency plays an important role by helping users become familiar with the digital landscape of your product so they can achieve their goals more easily.
  
* **Seek Universal Usability**
  * With increased use comes the demand for quicker methods of completing tasks. 
  * For example, both Windows and Mac provide users with keyboard shortcuts for copying and pasting, so as the user becomes more experienced, they can navigate and operate the user interface more quickly and effortlessly.

* **Offer Informative Feedback**
  * The user should know where they are at and what is going on at all times. 
  * For every action there should be appropriate, human-readable feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

* **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**
  * Don’t keep your users guessing. Tell them what their action has led them to. 
  * For example, users would appreciate a “Thank You” message and a proof of purchase receipt when they’ve completed an online purchase.

* **Prevent Errors**
  * Systems should be designed to be as fool-proof as possible, but when unavoidable errors occur, ensure users are provided with simple, intuitive step-by-step instructions to solve the problem as quickly and painlessly as possible.

* **Permit Easy Reversal of Actions**
  * Designers should aim to offer users obvious ways to reverse their actions. 
  * These reversals should be permitted at various points whether it occurs after a single action, a data entry or a whole sequence of actions.

* **Keep Users in Control**
  * Allow your users to be the initiators of actions. 
  * Give users the sense that they are in full control of events occurring in the digital space.

* **Reduce Short-term Memory Load**
  * Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. 
  * Therefore, interfaces should be as simple as possible with proper information hierarchy, and choosing recognition over recall.
  
### Norman and Shneiderman. Where they agree.

### Standards
* Internationally agreed and formalised. 
* Standards have come relatively recently to user interfaces.
* GUIs were starting to be inconsistent, incompatible, and
generally a mess. 
* So standards started to appear.

### Guidelines
* Guidelines are at a slightly higher level, often covering
content as well as design considerations. 

### Style Guides
* Style guides are more design focused, specifying interface
layouts. 
* Style guides are often found within a companies’ design
guidelines.
