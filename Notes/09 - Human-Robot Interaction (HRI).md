# Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

### What is a robot?
A robot is an autonomous machine capable of _sensing_ its environment, carrying out _computations_ to make decisions, and _performing actions_ in the real world.

### Robotics research
Greatly about moving from producing function-centered products to human-centered products.

### Affective Computing
1. Computing that relates to, arises from, or influences emotions.
   * Emotion recognition, modelling, and synthesis.
   * Emotion-aware HCI and HRI.
   * Mental health and inclusive technology.
  
2. Usability and heuristic evaluation of robot manipulation: effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, flexibility, robustness, utility.

3. Social acceptance: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude toward using technology, self efficacy, forms of grouping, attachment, reciprocity

4. User experience: embodiment, emotion, human-oriented perception, feeling of security, co-experience.

5. Societal impact: quality of life, working condition and employment, education, cultural context.
