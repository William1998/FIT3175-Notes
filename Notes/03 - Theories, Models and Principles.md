# Theories, Models and Principles
1. **Theories** are used to explain or understand a phenomenon. Theories are
used to analyse and predict how users interact with computer
interfaces for different tasks and in different contexts.

2. **Models** are used to describe user behaviour (e.g., goal formation, problem
solving, social interactions, organisational dynamics, etc.) Models are
abstractions of reality: they provide abstractions for thinking about
phenomena.

3. From a Physics perspective:
    * Theories try to provide a general statement to explain a phenomenon.
    * Models are a purposeful representation of reality.
    * Models are often used to describe an application of a theory for a particular case.

### Theories
1. **Theories** in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):
   * Efficiency - Computers are just tools for work.
   * Turn to social - Computers and people as social actors, in a context.
   * Not only work - Computing is ubiquitous, its for 'life'. 
   
2. **Theories**: Cognition.
   * Metaphors. Stems from theories in cognitive sciences (and philosophy), around the ways in which we can apply existing knowledge to a new problem
