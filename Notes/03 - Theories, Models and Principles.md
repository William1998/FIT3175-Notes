# Theories, Models and Principles
1. **Theories** are used to explain or understand a phenomenon. Theories are
used to analyse and predict how users interact with computer
interfaces for different tasks and in different contexts.

2. **Models** are used to describe user behaviour (e.g., goal formation, problem
solving, social interactions, organisational dynamics, etc.) Models are
abstractions of reality: they provide abstractions for thinking about
phenomena.

3. From a Physics perspective:
    * Theories try to provide a general statement to explain a phenomenon.
    * Models are a purposeful representation of reality.
    * Models are often used to describe an application of a theory for a particular case.

## Theories
1. **Theories** in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):
   * Efficiency - Computers are just tools for work.
   * Turn to social - Computers and people as social actors, in a context.
   * Not only work - Computing is ubiquitous, its for 'life'. 
   
2. **Theories**: Cognition.
   * Metaphors. Stems from theories in cognitive sciences (and philosophy), around the ways in which we can apply existing knowledge to a new problem.
   
3. **Theories**: Attention.
   * The process of selecting things to concentrate on.
   * Selective Attention: We get a mass of competing stimuli, but can be selective (think choosey) about what we pay attention to. BUT, that means we struggle to keep track of everything.
   * Divided Attention: We can divide our attention between tasks simultaneously (multi-tasking), but we only have so much ‘attention’ to share around (mental resources).
   
4. **Theories**: Perception.
   * How we acquire information from the world (via our senses). 
   * Traditionally, vision (sight) and auditory (sound) dominated. But, increasingly, haptic (sense of touch) is being used. 
   * Psychophysics gives us theories of how these senses interact, and their ’resolution’. 
   * This includes things like what colors to use, which sounds we attend to quickest, etc.

5. **Theories**: Memory.
   * We have short-term memory and long term memory. Our short term memory is easy to
overload. Miller (1956) famously suggested that we can only hold 7 (+/- 2) items in our
short-term (working) memory at any time. 
   * A driving force in interface design for a long time was ‘recognition is better than recall.’
   * If I show you many things, its faster for you to recognise something, than pull that something out of your memory on your own. 
 
6. **Theories**: Action.
   * Direct Manipulation.
   * Introduced by Shneiderman. Continuous representation of objects. User can directly manipulate those objects, using actions loosely corresponding to those in the physical world.
   
### Popular Modern Theories
1. **Von Restorff effect**
   * Also known as the "isolation effect".
   * Predicts that when multiple homogeneous stimuli are presented, the stimulus that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered.

2. **Hick's Law**
   * Describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has.
   * Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically.

3. **Fitt's Law**
   * Predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.

4. **Gestalt Law**
   * Humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Prägnanz.
