# User-Centered Design (UCD)

### What is Design?
* Plan the creation of a product or service with the intention of
improving human experience with respect to a specified problem.

* Design is a process that moves a project from uncertainty towards
certainty.

* Design, as a discipline, is the use of geometry to solve (people’s or
companies) problems or fulfill their needs.

* ‘Design is not just what it looks and feels like. Design is how it works.' (Steve Jobs)

* Design is not a one-time process. Its iterative and always evolving. Designs change. This may be a result of user testing, trends, errors, changing customers,
technical landscapes, etc.

* In system-centered design, technology drives the design while user-centered design is driven by the user alone.
