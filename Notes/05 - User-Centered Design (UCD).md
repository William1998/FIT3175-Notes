# User-Centered Design (UCD)

### What is Design?
1. Plan the creation of a product or service with the intention of
improving human experience with respect to a specified problem.

2. Design is a process that moves a project from uncertainty towards
certainty.

3. Design, as a discipline, is the use of geometry to solve (people’s or
companies) problems or fulfill their needs.

4. ‘Design is not just what it looks and feels like. Design is how it works.' (Steve Jobs)

5. Design is not a one-time process. Its iterative and always evolving. Designs change. This may be a result of user testing, trends, errors, changing customers,
technical landscapes, etc.

6. In system-centered design, technology drives the design:
    * What is easy to do with this platform? What can I pull together from existing tools? Etc.
