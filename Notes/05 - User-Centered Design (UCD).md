# User-Centered Design (UCD)

### What is Design?
* Plan the creation of a product or service with the intention of
improving human experience with respect to a specified problem.

* Design is a process that moves a project from uncertainty towards
certainty.

* Design, as a discipline, is the use of geometry to solve (people’s or
companies) problems or fulfill their needs.

* ‘Design is not just what it looks and feels like. Design is how it works.' (Steve Jobs)

* Design is not a one-time process. Its iterative and always evolving. Designs change. This may be a result of user testing, trends, errors, changing customers,
technical landscapes, etc.

* In system-centered design, technology drives the design while user-centered design is driven by the user alone.

### Advantages
* Can meet user needs

* Provides a tool to manage user expectations

* Get greater acceptance of end product/service

* Reduce product risk at the end

### Disadvantages
* Involving the user takes time, so may also increase costs

* Users are not great at precisely saying what they want

* Finding available users can be difficult

* When building on existing systems, users have little sense of constraints - can be hard to manage expectations
